# Seed Peers

Seed peers are our helpful allies that make it easy for the rest of us to connect to the network.

Most nodes connect to the Mina network using seed peers that are run explicitly at seed nodes.

## Running a Seed Node

The two important things about seed nodes:

1. Their address should be static
2. They need high uptime and be able to support many connections -- thus they should avoid doing as much as possible other than "seeding"

### Enforcing and publishing a static address

First of all, you need a static host where you'll be running your node. Preferably, you can use DNS and host your seed node at, for example: `seed.o1test.net`. Alternatively, you can also set up a static ipv4 address such as `82.230.217.200`.

Secondly, you'll need to select the port that your node is running on. By default, it's on `8302`.

Thirdly, you'll want to pregenerate your libp2p keypair -- this is used to identify you on the gossip network. To do so:

```
coda advanced generate-libp2p-keypair
```

This will generate a libp2p keypair on your machine.
And run your daemon with the `--discovery-keypair` flag:

Finally you'd publish your DNS address like so:

```
/dns4/seed.o1test.net/tcp/8302/p2p/12D3KooWGDHtsPUS8dZk3x3FUgsXCWwpnSJ6W7EwkWZKBZXczkwC
```

Or a static IP one in this manner:

```
/ip4/82.230.217.200/tcp/8302/p2p/12D3KooWCE97fGwuDCicVNK3ZWF8fVzfNezp3uGjmSc8VrRFem6a
```

This address string can be used for folks to connect to you.

### Tuning your node for uptime and high connections

Firstly, don't run block production or snark working on this node. Full stop. By doing neither of these things, the surface area for logic executing on this node reduces drastically.

It would be preferable to run with a larger `--max-connection` flag. At least 100. You'll still be able to seed with more than 100 nodes in total, it's just that you'll only be able to maintain connections with 100 at once.

## Minaprotocol.com Peers List

We will be hosting a peers list with a handful of O(1) Labs nodes and another much larger handful of addresses from folks unaffiliated with O(1). We have curated this list for nodes that they believe will be great seed peers and will try their best to keep the list up-to-date as well.

## Alternate Peer Lists

We have a decentralized network after all -- we encourage other members in the community to host seed lists. We did our best to curate a group of seeds that they think will have nice uptime and our trustworthy, but if you disagree, please talk to those you trust and use their addresses as seed peers.

To do so, you can swap the parameter `-peer-list-file` or `-peer-list-url` to point to another one.
